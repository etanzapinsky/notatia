Broken Things
 Don't do these things for fear of catastraphy
=============

- More than one inner linked capsule
- Highlight over a linked, or previously linked thing, text is removed
- Cant x out of more than one capsule
- Cant edit global capsule and retain highlightings of main capsule (both text and images have this problem)
- Search is really screwy
- When x out of popup edit capsule, will still highlight text
- Don't scroll page on images bc of fixed positioning
- Make sure to be clicking on image before starting to drag, otherwise will drag image and not create selection
- Don't draw popup edit box too close to bottom of page, will chop off the bottom
- Be careful with long titles
